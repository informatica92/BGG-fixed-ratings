# BGG-fixed-ratings
BGG is the biggest boardgame (and not only) enciclopedia. If you want information about a tabletop game that is the right place. Thousands of users all over the world comment and review games so that other users can evaluate a game before buying it...BUT hundreds of comments are not rated by users and this makes the general review of a game not properly correct. In this notebook we tried to give a rate to all those unrated comments and assigned to the hottest (top 50) games, a more accurate rating
